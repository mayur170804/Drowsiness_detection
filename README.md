# Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv5

This project performs **real-time object detection** using a **custom-trained YOLOv5 model** and a webcam feed. It captures frames through your webcam, runs object detection on each frame, and displays the output with bounding boxes and labels.

---

## Features

- Real-time object detection via webcam
- Fast inference using PyTorch and YOLOv5
- Supports custom-trained YOLOv5 weights
- Simple and lightweight Python implementation

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- YOLOv5 (via `torch.hub`)

---
