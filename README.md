# Drowsiness_detection
# 🧠 Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv5

This project performs **real-time object detection** using a **custom-trained YOLOv5 model** and a webcam feed. It captures frames through your webcam, runs object detection on each frame, and displays the output with bounding boxes and labels.
